# How to report a bug

Do you think you found a bug? Check <a href="https://github.com/dylan14567/configserver/issues"> the list of open issues </a> to see if your bug has already been reported. If not, send a new number.

Here are some tips for writing great bug reports:

* Describe the specific problem (eg, "The widget does not rotate clockwise" versus "an error appears")
* Include steps to reproduce the error, what you expected to happen, and what happened instead
* Check that you are using the latest version of the project and its dependencies.
* Include what version of the project you are using, as well as any relevant dependencies.
* Only includes one error per problem. If you have discovered two errors, present two problems
* Even if you don't know how to correct the error, including a failed test can help others locate it.

If you find a security vulnerability, do not open an issue. Instead, send a message from <a href="https://dylan14567.github.io/seguridad_superdylanyt"> https://dylan14567.github.io/seguridad_superdylanyt </a>.
